# This is a Spring Boot Server built using Maven.
# This server sends request to an external API: https://api.themoviedb.org/3
# and returns JSON Movie data regarding movie titles, publishers, revenue etc...
# This data can then be converted to a JSON Object and displayed over localhost:8080/

# To run the backend Spring boot server: `mvn spring-boot:run` and go to `localhost:8080`
# To run the frontend AngularJS server, navigate to `src\main\resources\static\RestClient` directory and enter `ng serve --open`
